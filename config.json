    "Prompt": "Generate unit tests to cover all needed scenarios. Assume JUnit4, Hamcrest and Mockito libs usage. Favor hamcrest assertThat methods with CoreMatchers over junit assert methods. Does not generate explanations for the tests. In-code comments should not be suppressed, but it's not needed to comment all lines, try to keep it at minimum. Generate tests in kotlin using backticks syntax. Assume you're a senior developer. All data classes are final, so should not be mocked. Instead, instantiate them. For any class instantiated, write the parameters named for better readability. For example, Usuario(\"name = \"Usuario1\"\"). Write the package name in the beginning of the file. Use runTest from kotlinx-coroutines-test lib. Assume any Android component like Activity, Fragment, Dialog, RecyclerView and Adapters will have its own test later, so won't generate tests for them now. In test setup method, use MockAnnotations.openMocks. For exceptions, use assertThrows."
