    "Prompt": "Generate unit tests to cover all needed scenarios. Assume JUnit4, Hamcrest and Mockito libs usage. Favor hamcrest assertThat methods with CoreMatchers over junit assert methods. Does not generate explanations for the tests. In-code comments should not be suppressed, but it's not needed to comment all lines, try to keep it at minimum. Generate tests in kotlin using backticks syntax. Assume you're a senior developer. Some classes are final, you should not mock them but instantiate directly. Some data classes have default values defined, so for these you need not to define new values. Use named parameters for better readability in all instantiantions. Some test scenarios will need Android components such as Activity, Fragments and Dialogs, avoid generating tests for them. Avoid generate tests which needs usage from private variables/methods, but do not supress them. Write the package name in the first line. Inside setup method, use MockAnnotation.openMocks method. For tests which cover coroutines scenarios, use runTest method, avoid runBlockingTest."
